### One binary. Full control. Declarative multi-agent orchestration made simple.

### What is YAFAI?

**Yafai** is a lightweight, high-performance multi-agent orchestrator built for power users. Itâ€™s designed to be a **drop-in executable** that exposes a fully customizable, config-driven agentic interface â€” no extra setup, no boilerplate.

Yafai follows an **opinionated orchestration flow**, but gives you **complete control** over what happens within it. Everything is defined through **declarative YAML**, making the system easy to configure, extend, and integrate â€” all from a single binary.

### Config-Driven Agentic Service Layer

Yafai exposes a config-driven agentic service layer. Pass a configuration file, and it exposes agentic interfaces ready to use. This approach allows for dynamic agent definition and connection, making it easy to adapt to different use cases.

### Core Philosophy

- **Explicit Over Implicit** : Configuration should be clear, verbose, and predictable â€” no magic.

- **Opinionated Flow, Extensible Logic** : The orchestration flow is fixed.What happens inside each step is fully customizable.

- **Config-Driven Architecture**: Agents are defined and connected using declarative YAML. One binary, endless flexibility.

- **Composable and Modular**: Users can inject, replace, or extend agents and flow steps without breaking the system.

- **Transparent by Default**: Built-in tracing ensures every agent's behavior is observable and debuggable.

- **Framework and Ecosystem Friendly**: Supports both core framework contributions and external modules/configs.

- **Minimal Runtime, Maximum Control**: Fast and lightweight.Designed for power users who need full control.
